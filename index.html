            <b>Supervised Learning</b>
            <p>-we are given a data set and already know what the correct output should 
                look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input 
                and the output. 
            </p>
            <p>-Supervised learning problems are categorized into either <b>"regression"</b> or 
                <b>"classification"</b> problems.
            </p>
            <p><b>Regression Problems -</b> we are trying to predict the results within a continous
                output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.
            </p>
            <p>Example 1 of regression problem:<br>
                -Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict
                thier price. Price as a function of size is continous output
            </p>
            <p>Example 2 of regression problem:<br>
                -Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the
                given picture.
            </p>
            <p><b>Classifcation problems -</b> we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete
                output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.
            </p>
            <p>Example 1 of classification problem:<br>
                -Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or 
                benign. binary
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>Unsupervised Learning</b>
            <p>-allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.
                We can derive structure from data where we dont necessarily know the effect of the variables.
            </p>
            <p>We can obtain this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables
                in the data.
            </p>
            <p>With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.</p>
            <p><b>Example: </b></p>
            <p><b>Clustering: </b>
                    Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these 
                genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan,
                location, roles, and so on.
            </p>
            <p><b>Non-clustering: </b>
                    The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment.
                    (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party)

            <b>Cost Function</b>
            <p>We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function</p>
            <p>This takes an average difference of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's 
                and the actual output y's
            </p>
            $${ J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left ( \hat{y}_{i}- y_{i} \right)^2 = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left (h_\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i} \right)^2 }$$

            <p>This function is also called the "Squared error function"</p>
            <p>Hypothesis: </p>
            $${h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x}$$
            <p>Parameters: $${\theta_0 ,\theta_1}$$</p>
            <p>Cost Function: </p>
            $${J(\theta_o  \theta_1) = \dfrac {1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta (x_i) - y_i)^2}$$
            <p>Goal: </p>
            $${\underset{\theta_0 , \theta_1}{minimum} = J(\theta_0 , \theta_1)}$$
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>Gradient descent</b>
            <p>Gradient descent algorithm is: </p>
            <p>repeat until convergence: for (j = 0 and j = 1)</p>
            $${\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \dfrac {\partial}{\partial\theta_j} J(\theta_0 , \theta_1)}$$
            <p> := is assignment operator</p>
            <p>alpha: is a number called the learning rate. What alpha does, is it controls how big of a step we take down the hill.
                If alpha is very large then we are talking very large and aggressive steps down hill. If alpha is small we are talking small conservate 
                steps down the hill.
            </p>
            <p><b>Correct Example of Simultaneous update:</b></p>
            $${temp0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \dfrac{\partial}{\partial\theta_0} J(\theta_0 , \theta_1)}$$
            $${temp0 := \theta_1 - \alpha \dfrac {\partial}{\partial\theta_1} J(\theta_0 , \theta_1)}$$
            $${\theta_0 := temp0}$$
            $${\theta_1 := temp1}$$
